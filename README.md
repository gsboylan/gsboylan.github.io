# Welcome!

Hi! If you're here, you're probably here because I sent you a link. If not, maybe someone else
linked to me (in which case, I am flattered) or I managed to accidentally hit some *very* specific
Google keywords.

Regardless of how you ended up here, welcome. If you know me, you probably know that I make a lot of
*things*. I am an engineer, and I would also consider myself a *maker*; the act of *making* is a hobby of mine.

Oftentimes when I share the things that I make, other people interested in making will ask me how,
or will request advice on how to go about projects of their own. My intention for this site is to be
an archive of the processes and practices I have learned, adapted, and iterated upon in my making of
things, and the tools I have found helpful along the way. I may or may not write build logs for
certain projects. I will generally try to release any source material I create back to the public
where it may be helpful.

All of the advice I offer is free of charge, licensed [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0
International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). In short, you are free to use,
distribute, or modify this content in any work you create, commercial or noncommercial, provided
that you attribute any content you lift from me back to my site where appropriate.
