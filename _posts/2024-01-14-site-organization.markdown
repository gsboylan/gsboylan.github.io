# The first is always the hardest

It's always difficult to conceptualize a data structure when you don't have any data yet. My
intention here is to have a straightforward layout that focuses on discoverability so that I can
link people directly to the homepage, where they will be able to easily locate the guide or build
log they're interested in.

I don't anticipate that anyone will follow this site as a blog, so blogging will be a lower priority
and I'll only implement the basics for now.

Being the first post on the site, everything here is subject to change. That said: in the interest
of having a written plan - for my own reference, if nobody else's -  this is how I'm currently
thinking of organizing the site:

- Posts will be structured, sequenced, and paginated via jekyll's built-in blog management infra.
I have no desire to roll my own blog CMS at this point in time.
- My homepage will list a few of the most recent posts, but it will also center a table of contents
organizing content into projects and guides, broken out by category.
