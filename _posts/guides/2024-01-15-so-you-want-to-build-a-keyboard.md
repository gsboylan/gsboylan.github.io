You've been bitten by the keyboards bug. You're probably entranced with flashy photography of sleek, minimalist
keyboards with impractically strange layouts. Maybe you're looking to learn more about working with electronics. Maybe
you've built a board with off-the-shelf parts and want to go to the next level. Maybe you've already built a dozen or
more keyboards and just want to see how other people are doing it.

In this series I'm going to lay out my processes for building keyboards, including the skills and tools that make up my
workflow. I'm not going to pretend that the way I do things is the only way - a lot of this comes down to personal
preference and habit. This is simply the way I do things, and I hope you find it helpful. 

Note that since this is a compendium of my personal techniques and processes, it will change over time. I will do my
best to consistently explain the changes I make and why I have done so, since usually these come about because I've
discovered a preferable alternative.
